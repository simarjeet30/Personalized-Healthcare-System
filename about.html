            <h2>Welcome to your personalised healthcare system</h2>
			<br>This is a website for our Sem 6 minor project where we help users figure out if they might have a common disease based on the symptoms they are experiencing.

			<br>In the second section, we take in patient data and use a logistic regression model trained on previous patient data to predict whether the concerned patient is infected with COVID-19 or not.<br><br>
			The user has to login in order to use this service. They can also see all previous patient data (without their names for anonymity).
			<br><br>The user can also check how the current humidity and temperature conditions of their room favor the spread of COVID-19, so they can take appropriate precautions if they happen to be favorable to COVID-19 spread.
